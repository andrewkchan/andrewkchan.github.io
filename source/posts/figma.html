    <h1>Reflections on Figma I: A Game-Changing Product</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <dt-byline></dt-byline>
    <p>
      It's been a few months since I left Figma, so I thought I'd write down some reflections on my time there before I forget.
    </p>
    <h2>Why did I work at Figma?</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest reason was the product. A designer friend introduced me to it around 2017 when designing the website for my college club and there was nothing like it: 
      a fully-featured, highly opinionated design tool on the web with Google-docs-style single-source-of-truth, unprecedented smooth performance, and pixel-perfect rendering. 
      I'd been using Photoshop before then - not even Sketch!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also thought the engineering team was exceptional: they knew what they were talking about in their blog posts, which showed both a willingness to take technical risks and an ability to
      carry them all the way through. It wasn't just one or two gems either; the blog was full of them. Here are some of my favorites:

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I made my final decision on where to go after college, I "reverse interviewed" a bunch of people from every company that accepted me, asking everyone questions like 
      "how would you characterize the growth of $COMPANY" and "why did you choose $COMPANY over others".
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think this influenced my decision too much, because Figma's product and engineering blog had already won me over, although it made me more excited that people were easy to talk to and
      it seemed like a culture fit. I was also impressed with how incisive some of the answers to my business-related questions were from Figma employees, which showed that they had thought about the same things
      that I did and made a rational decision to bet on Figma. Finally, Figma actually gave me the most reverse interviewees, so I had the clearest picture of what working there was actually like as opposed to 
      the other companies I was considering at the time.
    </p>
    <h2>What did I do at Figma?</h2>
    <p>
      I joined in 2019 when Figma had fewer than 100 employees and I think ~40 engineers. When I left in early 2024, we'd grown to over 1500 employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started out as a product engineer on several projects in Figma Design like animations and interactive/variant components.
      But most of my work was as a platform engineer in the core engine. Some highlights:
      <ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          I put the C++ engine used by our editor into our mobile app. One of the cooler technologies we developed as part of this was a 
          high-performance API from WASM/C++ to TypeScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          I helped migrate all code written in our <a href="/posts/skew.html">custom programming language</a> to Typescript with an automated migration.
        </li>
        <li>
          I worked on the stability of our mobile app a bunch, implementing optimizations from incremental document loading to binary serialization improvements.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also worked on the rendering performance of our whiteboarding tool. We managed to double FPS in intensive multiplayer scenarios by doing some 
          trickery with time-sliced rendering.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I also got to contribute to a few blog posts. Two of these I wrote a big chunk of and the third I was lucky enough to get a credit despite not really adding much:

      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Why did Figma succeed in design?</h2>
    <p>Lots of folks have written about this. Here's my take as someone who didn't get to sit in boardrooms or peer at growth metrics, but did get to sit through some of the action.</p>
    <p>
      It's easy to say of course we were bound to win, since we were the first to do Google Docs for design, fixing the versioning, sharing, collaboration, and device problem all at the same time.
      And as an outsider to design it felt like a no-brainer to me before joining, too. But looking carefully at the industry as a whole in 2015-2020, I think our destiny wasn't so obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it wasn't immediately obvious that “Google docs for design” was something designers actually wanted. There's a now-infamous top comment from the Designer News article for Figma's launch that 
      went something like: “If this is the future of design, I'm changing careers.”<dt-fn>Up there with the "why wouldn't I just use rsync" comment in the HN thread launching Dropbox for asking for faster horses!</dt-fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, it wasn't clear that Figma's browser-first approach to collaboration was enough of a moat.
      Yes, Figma links were a huge improvement over old design workflows and our product was spreading fast, but our competitors were racing to copy our features with Sketch Cloud and Adobe XD Cloud 
      Documents. XD had better prototyping and the vast resources of Adobe, while Sketch had pre-existing mindshare and was beginning to take venture capital. It's not hard to see a world where we ended 
      up in the same situation as Google Docs did with Office 365. There were also potential paradigm shifting players like Framer, in which designs were real React elements that designers could 
      manipulate directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I think what made us win was that:
      <ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          Browser-first link sharing let us convert non-designers (see <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/">Kevin Kwok's excellent <i>Why Figma Wins</i> from 2020</a>). This combined with 
          sticky features like design systems gave us powerful winner-take-all network effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our multiplayer technology turned out to be pretty hard for Adobe and Sketch to copy<dt-fn>Even in 2024, "design files not syncing properly" is one of the first results when I search for "Sketch Cloud".</dt-fn>. I would guess that this was less of a “collaborative algorithms are really hard to implement” and more of a 
          “existing products are really hard to make collaborative because legacy workflows impose extra edge cases” problem: Framer moved to browser-based collaboration pretty successfully, but it did so by 
          completely ditching its old product, and Figma-like design collaborative design tools created from scratch are pretty common these days.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      With all that said, it still took some pretty incredible engineering to not only successfully build design experience in the web, but to make it world-class and be the first folks to do it, too.
      As I suggested above, I think one of the biggest reasons we were able to gather so much engineering talent is because of how much the company blogged early on about the interesting problems they 
      were encountering and how they were solving them. Of course, it also helps that Figma took huge amounts of venture funding and leveraged Silicon Valley networks while Sketch spent years as a
      bootstrapped business in the EU.
    </p>
    <h2>What else did Figma try when I was there and how do I think they did?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Community</b>. This was originally supposed to make us the "Github for Design". I think we have probably not met those lofty goals, but the community is a great place to find pre-built assets
      and useful plugins. Even as someone who only dabbles in design I find it pretty useful: just a week ago I used it to find some AWS icons for an architecture diagram. That said, I don't use some of 
      the more fully featured assets like design systems, so I can't speak to how well those work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dev mode</b>. I'm not a frontend engineer<dt-fn>At least in the sense that I don't often write user-facing UI code. But a lot of my work was in the client-side codebase.</dt-fn>, so I don't have much to share about dev mode, having not used it very much. 
      However, I will note that aside from the new mode itself, Figma has had code generation for the web/Android/iOS for a long time, but as an afterthought, and with the release of dev mode,
      the team finally started paying more attention to that feature, and I have heard that it improved dramatically (particularly with the generated CSS containing proper layouts).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>FigJam</b>. I think the team knocked it out of the park with this one. Yes, it's essentially just a skin over Figma Design, but FigJam is one of the most polished, delightful products 
      I've used (obviously I am biased). Everything has been carefully designed, from the little animations when you drag a sticky into the canvas to the FPS you get when moving your mouse over the icons
      in the toolbar.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, business-wise, we faced more entrenched incumbents with FigJam, and our tech didn't give us much of a competitive advantage here: Miro et al. were already on the web, and while our 
      rendering tech still made us more performant in some cases, it also held us back, since it meant we couldn't bring in native UI functionality like videos and iframes as easily. We haven't won in this space, 
      at least not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Slides</b>. Figma Slides was prototyped at maker week years ago, but didn't become a real initiative until my last half-year or so at Figma. I'm pleasantly surprised by how polished the 
      product is and how well-received it has been by the community (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40802676">HN thread</a>) - personally, I didn't think it would be as successful 
      as it has been or why people would use it over tools like Google Slides. But maybe I just don't understand all the ways people use (or want to use) slides and the pain points with products today.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also some other cool projects that I won't talk about because they're not out yet!
