      This post is about building an LLM inference engine using C++ and CUDA from scratch without libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? In doing so, we can learn about the full stack of LLM inference - which is becoming increasingly important<dt-fn>Especially as inference compute becomes a new axis with which AI models scale,
      and models are increasingly deployed locally to devices on the edge.</dt-fn> - from CUDA kernels to model architecture, and get a real sense of how different optimizations affect inference speed.
      And one of the most important use cases is <i>running fast on a single prompt on consumer devices</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what we'll focus on: building a program that can load weights of common open models and do single-batch inference on them on a single CPU + GPU server, and iteratively 
      improving the token throughput until it surpasses <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>. Readers should have basic familiarity with large language 
      models, attention, and transformers. The full source code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm">yalm (Yet Another Language Model)</a>.

    <p>
      Let's recap how LLMs work, starting with their architecture and then moving onto inference mechanics. This will provide a starting point for an optimized implementation and help us establish benchmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost<dt-fn>There are also state-space models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a> which purport to be more efficient and scalable to long sequences than transformers, but they don't appear to have found much success outside of
      niches like <a href="https://www.cartesia.ai/">low-power ML and non-discrete data domains like audio/video</a>.</dt-fn> every major open-weights LLM uses the same architecture<dt-fn>To the point where new foundation models explicitly state that they 
      use a "standard architecture", with the value added being the training. This has led to some misunderstandings, see for instance <a href="https://blog.eleuther.ai/nyt-yi-34b-response/#how-all-llms-are-similar">https://blog.eleuther.ai/nyt-yi-34b-response/#how-all-llms-are-similar</a></dt-fn> 
      (sequential transformer blocks), with some minor variations/innovations since GPT-2:

    <p></p>
    <p>
      Loading models from different architectures is thus essentially defining a customizable transformer block class, then creating a sequence of these configured with the 
      right bells and whistles and initializing them with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/en/index">safetensors</a> weights. This article will focus on just 
      one architecture - Mistral v0.2 - but if you're curious you can read

    </p>
    <h2 id="section-1.1">1.1 Inference overview</h2>
    <p>
      At a high level, inference looks like the C++ pseudocode below:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
      <pre class="l-middle">        <code class="language-clike">
/* PSUEDOCODE */

void generate(Model&amp; model, std::string prompt, int steps) {
  std::vector&lt;int&gt; encoded = tokenizer.encode(prompt);
  InferenceState s(model);
  
  // 1. Prefill step: Forward the model on each prompt token, discarding 
  // the output. This lets the model read the prompt and hydrates the KV 
  // cache.
  for (int token : encoded) {
    model.forward(s, token);
  }
  // 2. Decode step: Forward the model repeatedly, generating 1 token at a time.
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; steps; i++) {
    model.forward(s, encoded.back());
    int next_token = sampler.sample(s.logits);
    encoded.push_back(next_token);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; tokenizer.decode_one(next_token) &lt;&lt; std::flush;
    if (next_token == tokenizer.EOS) {
      break;
    }
  }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
  <!-- </dt-code> -->
    <p>
      We can start to see differences between training and inference immediately. Inference - at least the local kind that we care about - is usually single batch. 
      For prompt completion and use cases like generating essays, the “decode phase” takes up the majority of execution and involves computing attention between the past context 
      and just a single token (or query timestep). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prefill step is more similar to training in that we're given a complete sequence to attend over, but more on that later. In chatbots there's also an “append” step when 
      passing the model additional user messages which is like prefill, but I won't talk about that in this article as our implementation will support only completions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The model forward pass looks like so:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
      <pre class="l-middle">        <code class="language-clike">
/* PSUEDOCODE */

// InferenceState is the minimum set of buffers needed to
// hold state during the forward pass and exists to avoid
// extra allocations
void Model::forward(InferenceState&amp; s, int token) {
  // The embedding table maps token IDs to embedding vectors,
  // which are copied into a buffer of the inference state
  s.x = copy_embedding(token, this-&gt;token_embedding_table);
  
  // Models consist of a sequence of transformer blocks which
  // mutate the inference state in order
  for (Block&amp; b : this-&gt;blocks) {
    b-&gt;block(s);
  }
  
  // Usually there is a layer norm right before the final classifier
  s.x = layernorm(s.x, this-&gt;lm_head_prenorm_weights);
  // Typically we end with a linear transform from (dim) -&gt; (vocab_size)
  s.logits = linear(s.x, this-&gt;lm_head_classifier_weights); 
}

void Block::block(InferenceState&amp; s) {
  s.x_resid = layernorm(s.x, this-&gt;att_prenorm_weights);
  // Multi-head attention typically includes: 
  // 1. RoPE on input (element-wise mutation w/ sines/cosines)
  // 2. QKV matmuls and updating the KV cache
  // 3. Causal self-attention, softmax, and value mixing
  // 4. Projection back into the residual stream
  s.x_resid = multi_head_attn(
    s.x_resid,
    this-&gt;wq, 
    this-&gt;wk, 
    this-&gt;wv, 
    this-&gt;key_cache,
    this-&gt;value_cache
  );
  s.x += s.x_resid;
  s.x_resid = layernorm(s.x, this-&gt;ffn_prenorm_weights);
  // On modern architectures like Llama, this is a GLU feedforward 
  // with 3 linear transforms, not a simple MLP:
  // -&gt; w2(F.silu(w1(x)) * w3(x))
  // Some architectures also split the FFN into a mixture of experts.
  s.x_resid = ffn(s.x_resid, this-&gt;w1, this-&gt;w2, this-&gt;w3);
  s.x += s.x_resid;
}
        </code>
    </pre>
  <!-- </dt-code> -->
    <p>
      This should look roughly familiar, if expressed a bit more low-level in typical C++ fashion. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing worth noting is that unlike training, inference can use a KV cache to store past keys and values for each block. 
      We keep things simple and implement this as a simple ring buffer (known as sliding window attention in the literature), which is sufficient to 
      support exact attention up to some maximum context length. Some exact attention implementations like PagedAttention use more complex KV caches to 
      improve aspects like memory footprint.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-1.2">1.2 Bottlenecks and benchmarks</h2>
    <p>
      Now we are ready to discuss bottlenecks and benchmarks. First, a fact: inference is memory-bandwidth-bound on modern hardware. For more, see 
      this <a href="https://zeux.io/2024/03/15/llm-inference-sol">excellent blog post</a> by Arseny Kapoulkine, but the gist of it is:
      </p><ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          Every time we generate a token we need to read the entire model, performing only a few floating point operations per weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modern CPUs and GPUs are <i>extremely</i> fast at floating point operations. The key metric is the FLOPs/s-to-memory-bandwidth-ratio (FLOPs/byte). 
          For instance, the AMD Ryzen 7950X has about a 40:1 ratio, while the RTX 4090 has an 82:1 ratio. The AMD EPYC 7702P on my server has a less impressive, 
          but still significant 10:1 ratio.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This is why <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/concept_guides/quantization">model quantization</a> is so effective at improving inference speed. 
      It's not just allowing the hardware to use faster instructions (which is sometimes true), 
      but also shrinking the input that we need to fit through the bandwidth bottleneck.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use bandwidth to establish a theoretical “speed of light”, or the max token throughput we can achieve. On my machine with an AMD EPYC 7702P and RTX 4090:

      Note that how close we can actually come to the theoretical bounds varies a bit depending on the hardware. We fortunately have a few popular inference

    <h1 id="section-2">2. Inference on the CPU</h1>
    <p>
      We begin with a naive implementation on CPU (the code is available <a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/blob/ec8c8fec911794c788c50dfe5d42ae9e1ef0e905/src/infer.cpp#L240">here</a>). 
      It's a straightforward single-threaded implementation with a 4k KV cache that only supports FP32 weights and no explicit SIMD of any kind. It achieves a blazing fast 
      throughput of 0.6 tok/s. Here's what that looks like:
    </p>
    <div class="l-middle">
      <video controls="" src="./yalm-assets/cpu-naive.mov" style="width: min(90vw, 720px)"></video>
    </div>
    <h2 id="section-2.1">2.1 Multithreading</h2>
    <p>
      The first optimization step we can do is to begin parallelizing our code on the thread level. Equipped with our handy OpenMP pragmas, we go hunting for embarrassingly parallel 
      opportunities. We'll optimize the same spots as llama2.c, and I'll go over each one to show the improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, <a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/commit/2a65dcbdff106976aeff1f08a037c6b6ece5b80b">adding a single line of code</a> parallelizes our widely matrix-vector multiplication 
      function so that each thread handles a row of the output:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
      <pre class="l-middle">        <code class="language-clike">
static void matmul(float* xout, float* x, float* w, int n, int d) {
  // W (d,n) @ x (n,) -&gt; xout (d,)
  int i;
#pragma omp parallel for private(i)
  for (i = 0; i &lt; d; i++) {
    float val = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
      val += w[i * n + j] * x[j];
    }
    xout[i] = val;
  }
}
        </code>
    </pre>
  <!-- </dt-code> -->
    <p>
      This is a big improvement that takes us to 4.2 tok/s with a bit of tuning to find the right number of threads:

      <video controls="" src="./yalm-assets/cpu-openmp-mm.mov" style="width: min(90vw, 720px)"></video>
    </div>

      Next, we can parallelize our multi-head attention computation (<a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/compare/2a65dcbdff106976aeff1f08a037c6b6ece5b80b..f39081de410ced856a4ba301234ab3fc6948e4a4">code here</a>) 
      so that each thread gets an attention head to compute. This is a less immediately clear improvement, but gets us to 
      4.4 tok/s for short context generations, and likely much better for long contexts.

    <h2 id="section-2.2">2.2 Weight quantization and SIMD</h2>
    <p>
      The next potential opportunity is to use SIMD. The EPYC 7702P CPU supports AVX and AVX2, which let us work with 256-bit vectors of 8 packed float32 values at a time. 
      In our ubiquitous <code>matmul</code> function, we could try loading, multiplying, and accumulating 8 values at a time in the inner loop, which would let each thread finish 
      its row-column dot product up to 8 times faster!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, inspecting our compiled code via <code>objdump</code> reveals that <code>matmul</code> is in fact already using AVX instructions (notice <code>vmovups</code>) to perform a vectorized dot 
      product in the case that the inputs are large enough. It seems GCC is too smart:

    <p>
      Let's turn to quantization. We won't explore the full gamut of quantized formats, since the goal of this article is to explore the breadth of optimizations, and we've 
      chosen our benchmarks with fixed formats. Instead, we'll just quantize our weights to FP16, which is the bare minimum needed to get it loaded onto the RTX 4090 VRAM anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hiccup is that many CPUs do not support native float16 math. But barring that, we'd like to keep our calculations in float32 as much as possible anyway to mitigate 
      effects on accuracy, and we should be able to without trading off performance as long as bandwidth remains a bottleneck. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So instead we leverage the fact that many CPUs do still support converting float16 values to float32 via the F16C x86 extension (which has been well-supported for over a 
      decade now) to load float16 weights and convert them to float32 just-in-time for calculations. Among other things, this requires us to explicitly vectorize the loads in 
      our matmul function from before because GCC doesn't know how to handle the half-precision arrays:

    <br>
    <p>
      Having quantized our model to half its size, we can now load it onto our RTX 4090 and begin a GPU inference implementation. 
      Remember our rules: raw C++/CUDA only, no CUTLASS, cuBLAS, cuDNN, or other libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you haven't seen CUDA code before, see <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/easy-introduction-cuda-c-and-c/">An Easy Introduction to CUDA C and C++</a> for a good intro. 
      At a high level, CUDA allows you to execute a C++ function (”kernel”) on the GPU in parallel over a <i>grid</i> of <i>threads</i> where:
      </p><ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          Each thread receives the same function arguments as all the others, but can make its own local variables, and is assigned its own <code>threadIdx</code> which can be used to determine 
          what work it is responsible for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Threads are additionally organized into blocks which have their own <code>blockIdx</code> and a fixed number of threads (<code>blockDim</code>). Threads in the same block can efficiently cooperate 
          by sharing data through shared memory, which is faster than the global memory that all threads in a grid may otherwise access.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of blocks and threads per block is specified when invoking a kernel in triple-chevrons <code>&lt;&lt;&lt; numBlocks, threadsPerBlock &gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and may be given as <code>int</code> or <code>dim3</code>.

    <p>
      This works because even though CUDA kernels are executed asynchronously, kernels on the same stream (or the default stream) will never execute 
      concurrently; one starts only when the previous finishes all threads. So we just need to have our final kernel write to device-mapped memory 
      on the host and perform a deviceSync at the end of the forward pass so that the output is available for sampling. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-3.2">3.2 Better matmuls</h2>
    <p>
      An interesting deep dive here is our <code>matmul</code> kernel. We saw earlier that this function was a huge piece of runtime on the CPU, and optimizing it 
      via OpenMP yielded huge wins. So let's make sure <code>matmul</code> is well-optimized before proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A naive implementation of <code>matmul</code> might look something like our OpenMP-parallelized CPU code, where we have each GPU thread handle computing 1 row (element) of the resulting vector:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->

  if (i &gt;= d) return;
  float sum = 0.0;
  for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; j++) {
    sum += A[n * i + j] * x[j];

      One big problem with this approach is that it will under-utilize our CUDA cores. Mistral-7B has a transformer input/output dimension of 4096, so if we're 
      computing (for example) the last matmul before the output, we'll spin up 4096 threads. But an RTX 4090 can have 16384 simultaneous threads! Many of our cores 
      will be sitting idle and we won't reach full FLOPs/s.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to FLOPs, there's also memory load coalescing issues with this kernel - but more on that later. Suffice to say that substituting this kernel in 
      for the one that we end up with leads to a throughput of 2.9 tok/s - slower than our CPU backend!
    </p>
    <p>
      A better idea is to have one block per row. Threads within a block can efficiently cooperate, so we'll be able to leverage more threads to speed up computing the 
      result for a single row. In this setup, each block will have exactly 1 warp (a smaller group of threads within a block which are a fundamental execution unit on the hardware, 
      with their own <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-cuda-warp-level-primitives/">cooperation primitives</a>), then we'll use a warp-stride loop to 
      sum across the entire row. At the end, we can perform a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/faster-parallel-reductions-kepler/">warp sum reduction</a> 
      to combine results from all threads:

      We can adapt the above kernel to blocks with more than one warp (it's easiest to keep 1 warp per row) as well. I will leave this and the question 
      of why that might be a good idea as an exercise for the reader. :)
    </p>
    <p>
      This kernel has much better thread utilization and memory read coalescing. With it configured to 1 warp per block, even with the near-1-1 arrangement 
      of functions to kernels, we get a throughput of 51.7 tok/s - pretty good performance for a preliminary implementation! That said, we still have a ways 
      to go before catching up to llama.cpp or calm - what can we improve?
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-3.3">3.3 Fusing and even better matmuls</h2>
    <p>
      Profiling a generation with <code>nsys</code> shows a few interesting things. First, we see that our GPU is being used for nearly the entire generation time, despite 
      the host-device syncs at the end of every forward pass. There are some gaps in the device thread, indicating occasional idle time, but they are on the 
      order of microseconds, which means we aren't ever CPU-bound:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/nsys-gaps.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 650px)">
    <p>
      Second, we can see that 94.4% of our kernel executions are matrix multiplications:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/nsys-mostly-matmul.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 650px)">
    <p>
      This means that if we were to get rid of every other kernel, we'd at best run in 94.4% of our current time, which would take us from 51.7 tok/s to 54.8 tok/s 
      throughput, which is not quite at our goal. So we still need to optimize our matrix multiplications.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, we can approximate getting rid of other kernels by fusing them together. In particular, there are a few kernels that we can fuse into the nearest matmul, 
      and a few matmuls that we can fuse together. For example, we can fuse together <code>matmul</code> and <code>add_residuals</code> into a single <code>fused_matmul_add_residuals</code> 
      that directly sums to the destination. The Mistral architecture also performs a gated sum of 2 matmuls at some point: <code>F.silu(w1(x)) * w3(x)</code> - and we can do 
      all of this in one kernel as all operations have 1 thread write to 1 element of the output vector, and all have the same dimension output.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can let us “blend” together 2 dependent operations. For the first example, <code>add_residuals</code> could not begin until all threads of <code>matmul</code> finished, 
      which is problematic if individual threads of <code>matmul</code> take longer. Additionally we avoid one extra read and write from each thread to global memory. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the curious, the full change is <a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/commit/7e3bb32a91117c9892363e8d2536b90cc2b1b2f3">here</a>. This takes us to 54.1 tok/s!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can return to optimizing <code>matmul</code>. From profiling via <code>ncu</code>, <code>matmul</code> writes are not optimally coalesced. The relevant warning diagnostic 
      is shown below:

    <p>
      At this point it's helpful to define what it means for a load or store to global memory to be coalesced in CUDA. When 
      threads in the same warp issue loads or stores to global memory, the loads or stores can be grouped together and 
      performed as a single transaction if they are appropriately aligned and refer to consecutive regions of memory 
      (see the diagrams in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5044424/4151721">excellent SO post</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is important because GPU global memory transactions can only be done at certain levels of granularity (32, 64, or 
      128 bytes). So if 32 threads in the same warp are reading or writing to distinct 4-byte floats, if the access is coalesced, 
      a single transaction of 128 bytes will be performed, whereas if the access is not coalesced, 32 transactions of 32-bytes 
      each may be performed, wasting a ton of bandwidth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our <code>matmul</code> kernel, reads are coalesced, but writes are not. We have 1 warp per block with each warp handling 1 output element, 
      so we are issuing 1 write per block of minimum size 32 bytes but only updating a single 4-byte element. Increasing the number of 
      warps per block does not help because coalescing is done at the warp level, not the block level. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, we can have each warp compute their own result, but then collect all results into lanes of the first warp, then have the first warp 
      issue a single coalesced write. The block-wide collection can be done fast through shared memory. The kernel:

      After adapting the final LM classifier and block <code>fused_matmul_add_residual</code> kernels to use this improved coalescing, 
      we reach 56.1 tok/s throughput:

    <h2 id="section-3.4">3.4 Attention and long context generation</h2>
    <p>
      One major opportunity for improvement is in long context generations. When generating 5k tokens, our model's 
      average throughput degrades to ~48 tok/s and attention kernels go from ~5% to &gt;10% of runtime. Compare this to llama.cpp and calm, 
      which are able to maintain throughput in the high 50s or greater. What's going on?
    </p>
    <p>
      With short context lengths, attention is fast - as there are not too many tokens to communicate over - and decoding is instead dominated by other, 
      non-context sensitive operations such as generating the q/k/v vector representations of the input and passing the attention block output through the 
      feedforward network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story is different with long contexts. This is constrained with sliding window attention, but as window size approaches hidden dimension, I'd 
      expect attention runtime to approach that of our feedforward network.
    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, let's consider how 2 attention operations (computing the attention scores, and using them to mix values) compare to a single matrix 
      multiply from dim to hidden_dim (the feedforward, which in modern architectures is based on a GLU rather than a simple MLP, should effectively contain 3 of these). 
      We have...
      </p><ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          Matmul going from <code>dim</code> to <code>hidden_dim</code>: <code>n_heads</code> dot products of size <code>head_dim</code> per row, <code>hidden_dim</code> rows
          <ul class="compact-li">
            <li><code>n_heads * hidden_dim</code> dot products of size <code>head_dim</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Attention over sequence of length <code>seq_len</code>:
          <ul class="compact-li">
            <li><code>n_heads * seq_len</code> dot products of size <code>head_dim</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Attention mix over sequence of length <code>seq_len</code>:
          <ul class="compact-li">
            <li><code>n_heads * seq_len</code> multiply-adds (of a vector of size <code>head_dim</code>)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In our benchmark, we use Mistral-v0.2 7B with <code>seq_len=4096</code> and <code>hidden_dim=14336</code>, so we'd expect our FFN matmuls to have roughly 3.5x the runtime of 
      our attention kernels.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see that this is about right for <code>attn</code> (our scoring kernel) which takes about ~50 μs vs. ~150 μs for the final FFN matmul:

      However, something weird is going on with our <code>att_mix</code> kernel, which is taking ~150 μs, the same amount of time as our FFN matmuls!

      Below is the naive kernel that we've been using to do this. The idea is to spin up a block for every element <code>out[q, i]</code> that we need to compute. 
      The threads of the block distribute over and mix the range of values <code>vb[:, q//G, i]</code> using a block-stride loop, then combine their results with a block sum

    <h2 id="section-3.5">3.5 KV quantization and compiler gotchas</h2>
    <p>
      This last section is about KV cache quantization, which is a common optimization we haven't done yet, but also about some of 
      the optimizations that the <code>nvcc</code> CUDA compiler does for you automatically, what can happen when they break, and how to fix them. 
      Earlier we saw how automatic vectorization needed to be made explicit when working with FP16 weights in our CPU backend, and as 
      we'll see, switching to an FP16 KV cache will require similar work.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a bit about KV cache quantization:
      </p><ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          In our benchmark setting earlier (<a href="#section-1.2">§1.2</a>), llama.cpp and calm were actually using FP16 KV cache entries (because that is 
          their default setting), and we calculated the speed-of-light assuming the same. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Quantizing KV cache entries from FP32 to FP16 will not yield as large of a win as quantizing our weights did, since the KV cache 
          comprises a much smaller part of the total memory, but we still expect a win nonetheless as the total memory read each forward pass 
          will go from ~15.5 GB to ~15.0 GB. The effect should be largest for long contexts and our attention kernels, as the KV cache is 
          only used in attention.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Just switching our KV cache from FP32 to FP16 (while still performing computations in FP32, just like weight quantization) is simple 
      and boils down to replacing <code>float*</code> with <code>half*</code> and inserting the <code>__half2float</code> intrinsic in a 
      few key places: <a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/commit/19a21912f2bd2e5ff0eb59bf5f3df1756038e3e0">see the code change here</a>. 
      Ensuring that it's performant is another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than make things faster, the naive patch above actually causes things to get slower. Long context generations are especially 
      impacted, with throughput down to ~53.6 tok/s from ~57 tok/s, and the <code>att_mix</code> kernel going from 5.5% (29 μs avg.) to a whopping 13.3% 
      of runtime (78 μs).

      An <code>ncu</code> profile on a toy example reveals that memory throughput for the att_mix kernel has gotten much worse, 
      going from ~25.7% of the memory speed of light to ~6.8% and 140 μs to 309 μs. Why? One issue may be that we are simply issuing 
      smaller memory transactions than we previously did in each iteration of our loop. Recall that in <code>att_mix</code>, each thread accumulates 
      a sum over timesteps <code>t</code> like so:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
    <pre class="l-middle">      <code class="language-clike">
float sum = 0.0;
for (int t = warp_id; t &lt; seq_len; t += t_stride) {
  sum += vh[kv_stride * t + i] * atth[t];	
}
// atomicAdd `sum` when we're done
      </code>
    </pre>
    <!-- </dt-code> -->
    <p>
      <code>vh</code> is now a half-precision array, so loads from it must be converted to FP32 before being used. Our naive 
      patch does this by simply inserting a <code>__half2float</code> call:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
      <pre class="l-middle">        <code class="language-clike">
float sum = 0.0;
for (int t = warp_id; t &lt; seq_len; t += t_stride) {
  sum += __half2float(vh[kv_stride * t + i]) * atth[t];	
}
// atomicAdd `sum` when we're done
        </code>
      </pre>
    <!-- </dt-code> -->
    <p>
      This results in lower throughput because even though loads are still being coalesced in each warp for each loop iteration, 
      they are coalesced to 32 16-bit loads, or 64 bytes, which is lower than the maximum coalesced transaction size of 128 bytes 
      that can be issued by a warp. We can try recovering this performance by vectorizing the loads into <code>half2</code> loads like so:
    </p>
    <!-- <dt-code block language="clike"> -->
      <pre class="l-middle">        <code class="language-clike">
float2 sum01 = make_float2(0.0, 0.0);

      This attempt (<a href="https://github.com/andrewkchan/yalm/commit/ce8efcd20a5f1c04e69ff05a334cbc3aa951eac1">full patch here</a>) 
      improves the throughput somewhat, but it's still worse than the float32 version (188 μs vs. 140 μs, memory throughput 9.8% vs. 25.7%).
    </p>
    <p>
      What's going on? Our KV cache loads should be coalesced to the same sizes as the FP32 version. The final writes we do are 
      double the size, but reads far outnumber writes, and they should also still be coalesced. For hints, we collect a more 
      detailed <code>ncu</code> profile with <code>-set full</code> and <code>-o report</code> to get a file that we can view in the NCU UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, we can see a very powerful line-by-line breakdown of the kernel being executed, with relevant stats and the corresponding 
      PTX and SASS instructions per line. In particular we see that the line loading from <code>vb</code> in the FP32 kernel is secretly 
      performing 8 32-bit loads:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/source-cuda-kv32.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 700px)">
    <p>
      ...while the corresponding line in the FP16 kernel is performing only 1 32-bit load:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/source-cuda-kv16.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 700px)">
    <p>
      Digging deeper, we can see that the compiled SASS instructions for the FP32 kernel have not only unrolled the loop into 4 iterations 
      (=8 loads) at a time, but are also arranging the load (<code>LDG.E</code>) and arithmetic (<code>FFMA</code>) instructions so that the loads can be 
      <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/boosting-application-performance-with-gpu-memory-prefetching/">prefetched</a>:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/source-sass-kv32.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 700px)">
    <p class="caption">
      <i>
        The highlighted lines all correspond to the single selected line in the CUDA code above in the FP32 kernel.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prefetching is a big boost for loops where each iteration loads from global memory and is independent from the results 
      of previous iterations. By unrolling 4 iterations of the loop and re-arranging all loads upfront, the compiler is able to hide 
      the latency of the loads for the latter 3 iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FP16 kernel SASS does not even unroll any loop iterations, let alone rearrange loads:
    </p>
    <img src="./yalm-assets/source-sass-kv16.png" class="l-middle" style="width: min(90vw, 700px)">
    <p>
      So how do we get prefetching in the FP16 kernel? Unfortunately, just adding <code>#pragma unroll</code> to the loop does 
      not cut it (at least on my <code>nvcc</code> and machine setup). We are at the whim of compiler heuristics; they gaveth to our FP32 kernel 
      but now taketh away, and may continue to taketh away unless we instead 
      <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/boosting-application-performance-with-gpu-memory-prefetching/">manually unroll and prefetch values</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, we have unrolled into 16 iterations (=32 loads) at a time, with some extra code to handle the iterations modulo 16. 
      We perform a batched prefetch<dt-fn>An even better solution might be to do a rolling prefetch using pipeline instructions. See the NVIDIA blog post linked above for more.</dt-fn> 
      where at the start of every 16th iteration, we issue a batch of loads, then retrieve them one-at-a-time until our batch is depleted. 
      The use of scalars instead of an array to hold prefetch results allows us to fetch to registers rather than slower 
      shared memory:

      And long context generations get faster as expected, from just over 57 tok/s to 58.8 tok/s. To top it all off, here's a video of 
      short context generation, where we get over 63.8 tok/s:

    <h1 id="section-4">4. What's next</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      Through this post, we've achieved close to state-of-the-art performance for a specific use case: local, completion-only, 
      single-batch, single-GPU inference on one model. We were able to do so with no libraries - just a few major optimizations 
      and a lot of CUDA/C++ elbow grease:
      </p><ul class="compact-li">
        <li>
          Multithreading and vectorization on the CPU
        </li>
        <li>
          Matmul warp reductions + coalescing, kernel fusing, and better attention in our GPU backend
        </li>
        <li>
          Weight + KV cache quantization for both backends
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      That said, we've only scratched the surface of LLM inference performance. Even in our specific use case there are lots of improvements to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      One big opportunity is in the prompt pre-filling phase, where we have an existing sequence, similar to training time. A common optimization 
      here is to use matrix-matrix multiplication instead of matrix-vector to prefill multiple KV cache entries at once; this would improve the time-to-first-token,
      a metric just as important as raw token throughput for many applications. This also forms the basis of 
      the <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1697318534555336961">speculative decoding</a> generation idea, which takes advantage of the fact that pre-filling K tokens is not that much slower than generating a single token.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another opportunity is to fuse our attention kernels, which the naive implementation split into separate scoring, softmax, and mixing operations. 
      This is essentially what FlashAttention does for training and FlashDecoding does for inference, with some clever insights about the underlying hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll also note that we are fast for FP16, but we're not FAST yet. Reaching 100 tok/s on our machine will require us to quantize more 
      aggressively, to smaller data types like FP8, INT8, or INT4, or to quantize activations<dt-fn>This is often done during training, 
      where we have large batches of activations that must be kept around for gradient computation in all layers. For single-batch inference it is less beneficial especially as we can reuse tensors between layers.</dt-fn>
      and KV cache entries as well as weights. Or to do computations natively in lower precision!
    </p>
    <p>
      At a low level, there are lots of kernel-specific implementations to be made. Many of the kernels we ended up with still display 
      suboptimal performance, with several having memory throughput of less than 60% of the speed-of-light. Kernel optimization is a 
      huge topic and many of the optimizations we discussed - memory coalescing, vectorization, pre-fetching, etc. - need to be combined 
      in complex ways to really reach peak performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in a production implementation, it's much more practical to use libraries of kernels maintained by experts, which are usually 
      state-of-the-art, like cuDNN kernels and cuBLAS. These libraries have had decades of work go into them and are made by the same folks designing 
      the chips themselves, to the point where even approaching <a href="https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM">within 5% performance of cuBLAS</a> 
      on specific hardware and use case is considered an achievement. Of course, this route is also usually less fun :)
